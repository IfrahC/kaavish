\section{Problem Statement}

Code School currently manages instructor recruitment, onboarding, class assignments, and payments through manual and disconnected processes. As the organization expands to serve over 20 countries and thousands of classes, these manual operations lead to inefficiencies, scheduling conflicts, and inconsistencies in instructor-student matching. Moreover, tracking instructor performance and maintaining centralized access to class-related data has become increasingly difficult, resulting in administrative overhead and limited scalability.

The problem lies in the absence of an integrated, automated platform that can streamline these operations, reduce human error, and allow instructors and administrators to focus on improving the quality of education rather than managing logistics.

\section{Proposed Solution}

To address these challenges, we propose a web-based application designed to automate and centralize Code School's instructor and class management processes. The platform will serve as a single portal for managing instructor recruitment, onboarding, class scheduling, student assignments, and payment tracking.

The system will leverage Machine Learning to intelligently match students with instructors based on factors such as age, proficiency, and coding language expertise. It will also integrate with the Zoom API to automatically generate and distribute meeting links for scheduled classes. Furthermore, the platform will use performance analysis algorithms to assess instructors based on metrics such as engagement, teaching effectiveness, and adherence to the curriculum.

By automating administrative workflows and integrating key functionalities into one dashboard, the system will streamline operations, ensure efficient scheduling, enhance class quality, and provide valuable insights into instructor performance.

An overview of the system’s modules and functionalities is presented here, while detailed descriptions are provided later in Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}.

\section{Intended User}

The primary users of this system are instructors working at Code School. They will use the platform to view their assigned classes, access student information, join scheduled Zoom sessions, and track performance metrics through an intuitive dashboard.

The administrative team will also use the platform to manage instructor recruitment, monitor performance analytics, handle scheduling logistics, and process payments efficiently.

Overall, the system is designed to serve both instructors and administrators, providing each with the tools and data necessary to ensure smooth operations, high teaching standards, and an improved learning experience for students.
